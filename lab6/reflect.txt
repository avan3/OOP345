Originally in this lab, I defined one the derived product class and the ProdUtil cpp file to read the product information from the
file. I then created the TaxableProduct class after this and I ran into many errors. 
Later, I realized that I need to create the definitions for all the classes in the hierarchy. After this, and referring to the
notes on derived classes from last semester. I used pointers to the iPointer class that would accomplish calling the correct 
functions depending on the type of the object.
