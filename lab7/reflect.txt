In workshop 7, I developed a better understanding of how to use the C++ algorithms. Initially, I thought that the algorithms do not
return anything and that they would just modify the current variables you input into the algorithm. However, I realized that was wrong.
For the C++ algorithms, they return a value that is the result of what the algorithm does. Knowing that, the lab became much easier.
I saved the variable result from the algorithm and used them in the equations to solve the problems. The only thing I need to learn is
what the order of operations is within an algorithm with a lambda.
